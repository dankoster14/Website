Assignment 2 – CTEC3905 Front-end Web Development

While I was developing the website for the assignment I decided to develop a website for the sports club that I am in the committee for.

I decided to keep the colour scheme of the website relevant to the sports in question I decided to use a black, green and white colour scheme.

So, the header on all pages is in dark green with the background surrounding it and the navigation bar is black, with the content background in white to avoid any colour clashes with any of the images.

During the development stage I part of the brief of the assignment was to make sure that the website is responsive on other types of devices for example mobile devices and tablets, I have provided screenshots on how this looks on these devices.

During the development of the website, more specifically the navigation bar, the issue that I experienced with that was the Javascript that I used to code the responsiveness of the bar was that when the size was decreased and the menu elements went into their sub menu when clicked the elements wouldn’t appear, this was because I had implemented the script in the wrong place in the html file, I had put it underneath where I had declared my stylesheet. I solved this by putting the script declaration at the bottom of the html file.

On the latest results page I included an animation, where two images continuously rollover each other at regular intervals, the images are an 8 ball
